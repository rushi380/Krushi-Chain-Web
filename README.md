KrushiChain
Blockchain-Powered Agricultural Platform for Indian Farmers

KrushiChain is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Aptos blockchain to empower Indian farmers by creating a secure, transparent, and efficient digital ecosystem. It aims to solve critical challenges in agriculture, such as fragmented data, lack of trust in supply chains, and slow subsidy disbursement, by leveraging the immutability and transparency of blockchain technology.

Features
üå± Land Registration: Farmers can register their land on the Aptos blockchain, creating an immutable and verifiable record of ownership and crop details.

üì± QR Code Verification: Generates unique QR codes for each registered land record, allowing buyers, government officials, or other stakeholders to instantly verify details on the Aptos network.

üìä IoT Data Integration: Captures real-time sensor data (temperature, humidity, soil moisture) and stores it on the blockchain, providing a transparent and secure record of farming conditions.

üí∞ Subsidy Management: Uses an Aptos Move smart contract to automate the subsidy eligibility and disbursement process, ensuring fair and rapid payments directly to the farmer.

‚õìÔ∏è Transparent Records: Every transaction, from land registration to sensor data storage, is recorded on the Aptos testnet, providing a public and auditable ledger.

Tech Stack
Blockchain: Aptos Testnet

Smart Contract Language: Aptos Move

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Libraries: qrcode.min.js, Aptos Wallet Adapter (simulated)

Getting Started
This project is a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) intended to demonstrate the core functionalities of KrushiChain.

Prerequisites
A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

An Aptos-compatible wallet (e.g., Petra Wallet) for a live version.

A basic understanding of blockchain and web development is helpful.

Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone [your-repo-url]

Navigate to the project directory:
cd KrushiChain

Open the index.html file in your browser.

Note: The current version uses simulated Aptos wallet and transaction logic for demonstration purposes.

Usage
Connect Wallet: Click the "Connect Aptos Wallet" button to simulate a connection to the Aptos network.

Land Registration: Fill out the form with the farmer's details and click "Aptos Blockchain ‡§µ‡§∞ ‡§®‡•ã‡§Ç‡§¶‡§£‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§∞‡§æ" to register the land on the simulated blockchain.
